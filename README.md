# Asteroids

This project was credited by the awesome website **RealPython**

reference : [Build an Asteroids Game With Python and Pygame](https://realpython.com/asteroids-game-python/)

Originally this project was built for the 2021 CRCWC. We firstly decided to teach those participants to write this on their own. 
However, after we had a meeting, our adviser suggested that we should change a topic for teaching because the knowledge it contained wasn't easy enough to be understood in a 3-day lesson.
So we gave up this project. But since I've built this project, I decided to put it on there.
